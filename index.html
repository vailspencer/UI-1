        I was 19 years old when I left Nigeria. I had just completed my secondary school education and I was ready to start my first year of University when a man approached my mother with a proposition for me to go study abroad. He managed to convince my mother that he could get me a scholarship in Italy and all I had to do was give him the necessary documents for him to process the paperwork. </br></br>

        After a few weeks the man came to our house and informed my mother that I had been accepted into a school in Italy and that it was a fully paid scholarship. He also informed us that I would be travelling by air to Europe and we should leave everything in his hands. Neither I nor my mother had ever travelled outside of Nigeria, let alone taken a flight. So when the man said that we would depart from the northern state of Nigeria instead of my home state Lagos, we did not question him.

        My name is Shafiq and I arrived in Greece from Pakistan in 2017. I worked for eight years at a gas station in Pakistan, but my income was very low, so I decided to leave for Europe.</br></br>

        I ended up in Greece, hoping to earn enough to provide for my family in Pakistan. Despite finding work in the agriculture sector, my income was simply not enough to support my family and myself. I started to think more and more about my wife and our two children, so I decided to apply for IOM’s Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration programme.

         I am a chemistry professor and thanks to my work at a university, I was able to get a scholarship to study a doctorate in the city of Montreal, in the province of Québec.</br></br>

        One of the initial difficulties I faced was language. Even though my English is good, I am in a francophone province, that also has a very particular way of speaking which is not taught in French classes in my country. The change in my field of study and returning to school after 8 years of graduating from college were difficult as well.
